# climate-effects-boreal-forests
 This repository contains codes to estimate the radiative forcing of forests based on their albedo and carbon sequestration. 
 The repository is part of the M.Sc. Thesis project by Anna Valeria Requardt (SLU, Uppsala, Sweden).

GEE codes for downloading raw data can be found in the file "GEE data download code". Afterwards, data can be processed using the R scripts: 
1) creating S2-resolution albedo maps (S2_albedo.R)
2) calculating radiative forcing (RF_models.R)
3) applying statistics to the data (statistics.R)
4) validating data (data_validation.R)
